# CubeResultsTracker
Designed to track the 'metagame' of a Magic: the Gathering environment, tracking both winning/losing cards as well as deck types.

At the moment the project is a prototype - the future roadmap is designing a GUI, then adding functionality for working with Google Sheets so that users aren't required to be able to run Excel files, and also so that users can access their data from anywhere.

This project tracks the 'metagame' of a Magic: the Gathering environment, and is specifically designed for 'cube' designers (people who curate a collection of Magic cards that is meant to be played via 'drafting'). The goal is to create software that helps cube designers figure out which cards to cut because they are either too powerful or not powerful enough, as well as which strategies need to be buffed/nerfed.
