# CubeResultsTracker
Designed to track the 'metagame' of a Magic: the Gathering environment, tracking both winning/losing cards as well as deck types.

The gist of the project is that after each session of a "cube draft," essentially a Magic: the Gathering format in which players take turns picking cards from booster packs (comprised of cards from a static, curated card pool) to build decks, the user logs the cards of both the best and worst-performing decks in an Excel spreadsheet. The program then reads the spreadsheet and analyzes the logged decks, telling the user which cards and decks appeared in winning and/or losing decks, as well as how often.

At the moment the project is a prototype - the future roadmap is designing a GUI, then adding functionality for working with Google Sheets so that users aren't required to be able to run Excel files, and also so that users can access their data from anywhere.

This project tracks the 'metagame' of a Magic: the Gathering environment, and is specifically designed for 'cube' designers (people who curate a collection of Magic cards that is meant to be played via 'drafting'). The goal is to create software that helps cube designers figure out which cards to cut because they are either too powerful or not powerful enough, as well as which strategies need to be buffed/nerfed.
